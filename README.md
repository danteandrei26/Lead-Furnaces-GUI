# Lead-Furnaces-GUI
This is a GUI app created with Tkinter (Python) that generates a .csv file with commands. Those commands controls certain parameters for 6 furnaces (lead melting facilities). 


"Improved Organization" is a new (unfinished) version of the same app but devided in multiple classes, folders and functions. 
This is my attept to convert a "script" GUI into a real app using OOP and designing robust functions for further usage.
